            <h2><strong>🎇Welcome to this magical world! </strong></h2>
            <p><br>Welcome to <strong>the Fairy Kingdom</strong>, where you can enjoy both oracle readings and story-based adventures guided by your own choices.<br><br>This site offers two main contents:<br><strong>✨Oracle Readings</strong> using original cards✨<br><strong>👑A journey through the Fairy Kingdom</strong>, where you shape your own story✨<br><br>These are accessed through separate buttons, but both are set in the same magical world.<br><br><strong>✨Oracle Readings</strong><br>In the oracle readings, fairies living in the kingdom gently share messages tailored to your current mood or concerns.<br>Each fairy has their own way of interpreting the cards, so even the same card may offer different insights depending on who delivers it.<br>It's more than just an automated reading — it's a gentle conversation with a magical guide.<br><br>The menu begins with lighthearted readings, and over time, new options will be added that gently support deeper emotional struggles.<br>These readings are not about "fixing" your problems, but about offering a quiet space — a place to rest your emotions for a little while.<br><br><br>👑In the journey, you'll step into the story as your own character. Your choices shape how the story unfolds, and the ending changes depending on the path you take.<br>You'll meet various characters living in the kingdom and travel alongside them through a unique, personal adventure. ✨<br><br><strong>🔔Please note</strong>: All characters and stories are fictional. Social media posts are also part of this world-building. Thank you for understanding.<br><br><br><br>🌞The website is currently under preparation and is scheduled to launch in <strong>Fall 2025</strong>. Please stay tuned!<br><br><br>
